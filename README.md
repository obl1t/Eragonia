# Eragonia
The final game project my team made for the second semester of our Video Game Programming I class. Eragonia is a combination of a roguelike, a resource management game, and a tower defense. Defend against 39 waves of enemies while investing in resource towers to build up your defenses. Collect enough resources to tier up your civilization, unlocking new towers and new upgrades for your existing towers. Made completely in C# using XNA Monogame w/ Visual Studio.
